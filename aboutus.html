		Hey! My name is Alice and welcome to my website! Thank you for taking the time to visit my website to see what I'm all about. Currently there is not as much displayed on here as I would hope to have in the future but that is because I am relativley close to the start of my Journey within the Tech world, so as you see you progress along my journey hopefully more things will pop up here for you to check out! <br> <br>

		Currently I am a cybersecurity student who is learning other Computer Science related skills in my free time to expand upon my skillset and broaden my knowledge to allow me as many opporunities as possible. My current focus is with Frontend Development for the Web, as demonstrated by my creation of this website to display myself and my portfolio to those who may be interested. My next goal will be for when I start my course and purchase a low-end server to be able to self host more things and gain some independance from large companies solutions to media storage etc. <br> <br>

		At the moment this website is hosted on my Github to allow for an easy and simple hosting solution whilst allowing me to learn Git in more depth to make my developments currently and in the future more streamlined and efficient. Thank you for checking out my blog and if you have any questions or things you would like to know please don't hestiate to contact me through the dedicated button on my homepage! <br>
